# About the project:

Build a Buddy is a toy store that provides customers with a fun and creative way to personalize stuffed animals. The customer begins by choosing a stuffed animal, and then selecting accessories to customize their look. When the customer is satisfied with their selections, an employee will fill the stuffed animal with padding, and affix all the accessories. After assembly is complete, the customer pays the “adoption fee” and gives their new buddy a name.

# Notice:

- For demo purpose, the project is ready for development environment only. For production environment, it would require extra settings.
